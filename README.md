Hey hello, I'm **Martin Dvorak**,

I do programming both for a living (Python/7y, Go/1y, Java/23y) and for my own personal pleasure (C++/10y, C/8y). I like all flavors of programming — I prefer strongly typed languages, however, I did my master's thesis in logic (Prolog/3y) and functional (ML/2y, Haskell/3y, Lisp/4y) languages and fell in love with them. I value **freedom** — I'm an open-source believer and the [right to fix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Npd_xDuNi9k) supporter.

I use my **open-source projects** on a daily basis:

* **[Mind Forger](https://github.com/dvorka/mindforger)** (C++)
    - A thinking notebook to maintain what I learned and understood over the last 30 years — 16k+ notes in 800+ notebooks.
* **[HSTR](https://github.com/dvorka/hstr)** (C)
    - Fastest [zsh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell) and [bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) history search for the terminal.
* **[SlakeMoth](https://github.com/dvorka/coaching-notebook)** (Java)
    - Auto coach helping me to systematically plan, solve problems, learn from mistakes, and brainstorm using SWOT, SMARTER goals, and Eisenhower matrix in the wheel of life.
* **[MyTraL](https://github.com/dvorka/my-training-log)** (Python)
    * A training and personal log, where I synchronize, aggregate, digitize, normalize, analyze, and predict the sports activities I have done since 1996 and will do today.

I like to read math books (I'm really bad at it) and the source code of interesting projects before going to sleep - especially [VMs](https://github.com/dvorka/logr-jvm-gc), compilers, and machine learning models.

My **heroes** are [Linus Torvalds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idLyobOhtO4), [Bjarne Stroustrup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C%2B%2B_Programming_Language), [Don Knuth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BdBfsXbST8), [James Gosling](https://github.com/bobbae/gosling-emacs) x [Richard Stallman](https://www.gnu.org/gnu/manifesto.en.html),  [John Carmack](https://github.com/id-Software/DOOM/blob/a77dfb96cb91780ca334d0d4cfd86957558007e0/linuxdoom-1.10/r_main.c#L438), [Andrew Ng](https://www.andrewng.org/) and [Andy Wier](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tfh6OUUYUw).

If you're ever in **Prague** and have similar interests or use my projects, get in touch and we'll have a beer!
